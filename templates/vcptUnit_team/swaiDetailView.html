								conducting and supervising semi-field and field studies collecting entomological data and its
								analysis. He is currently registered for a PhD and works at the Vector Control Product Testing Unit
								(VCPTU) primarily leading the evaluations on spatial repellents but also supports phase II
								(experimental hut) evaluations of long-lasting insecticidal nets. Before joining VCPTU, he led
								several research projects in south eastern Tanzania including, a malaria prevalence survey across
								several villages of Ulanga district and on a project that aimed to develop low-cost and portable
								mosquito-proof houses to protect migratory rice farmers from mosquito-borne illnesses. He is
								interested in the control of vector borne diseases, specifically in understanding the role of migratory
								livelihoods in maintaining the transmission of malaria. He is keen on developing research agendas
								that incorporate this aspect as well as the development and evaluation of novel mosquito control
								tools, particularly those that can be used by migratoryÂ communities.</p>
